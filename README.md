### Summary
This repository contains the R code used in 
Lemasson, B., Tanner, C.J., Woodley, C., Threadgill, T., Qarqish, S., and Smith, D. 2018. Motion cues tune social influence in shoaling fish. *Sci. Rep.* - *In press*. 

The R code stored here is not comprehensive, but should provide enough transparency to replicate our methods. Some of the data wrangling that was done is not yet included, but may be added at a later date. The repository's contents should be self-explanatory based on a reading of the paper. All library packages are listed in one file (**PackagesAndGlobalSettings.txt**) and sourced from each R file.  All code was last checked using **R** version 3.4.1. Feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns related to the material.
