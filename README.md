### Summary
This repository contains the R code used in [Lemasson et al. 2018, *Sci. Rep.*: Motion cues tune social influence in shoaling fish (*In Press*)]().

The R code stored here leans more towards a compact rather than comprehensive documentation of our methods. The material none-the-less provides enough transparency to replicate the findings presented in the paper. The repository's contents should be self-explanatory based on a reading of the paper and the **R** code files. All library packages are listed in one file (**PackagesAndGlobalSettings.txt**) and sourced from each **R** file.  All code was last checked using **R** version 3.4.1. Feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns related to the material.

The data files found in the `Data` directory can also be accessed @ [Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity](https://doi.org/10.5063/F1P26W9D).
