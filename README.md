### Summary
This repository contains the R code used in <a <em>Lemasson et al. 2018, Sci. Rep.</em>: Motion cues tune social influence in shoaling fish</a> (*In Press*).

The R code stored here leans more towards a compact rather than comprehensive documentation of our methods (we can be a bit messy). The material none-the-less provides enough transparency to replicate our methods and findings. Some of the data wrangling that was done is not yet included, but may be added at a later date. The repository's contents should be self-explanatory based on a reading of the paper. All library packages are listed in one file (**PackagesAndGlobalSettings.txt**) and sourced from each R file.  All code was last checked using **R** version 3.4.1. Feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns related to the material.
